Abstract = {The raw materials of ``licorice root{''} in the commerce consist of
   roots and/or rhizomes (stolons) of different species of Glycyrrhiza.
   Licorice products and raw materials are frequently mislabeled and often
   have mixed, misidentified, or unidentified species and parts. This paper
   provides a detailed comparative analysis of the morpho-anatomies of the
   rhizomes and roots of five species of Glycyrrhiza, namely G. glabra, G.
   uralensis, G. echinata, G. inflata, and G. lepidota, by bright-field
   light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The studied species
   showed some similarities in their basic anatomical features due to the
   fact that they are phylogenetically closely related and belong to the
   same genus. However, differences in microscopic features such as the
   thickness of cork and medullary rays, pore frequency, and size of the
   vessels were observed. The rhizomes can readily be distinguished by the
   presence of a distinct pith. The roots lack a well-defined pith and
   instead have primary xylem in the center.},

Title = {DNA Barcoding and Species Delimitation for Dogfish Sharks Belonging to
   the Squalus Genus (Squaliformes: Squalidae)},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Squalus genus comprises a group of small demersal sharks occurring
   circumglobally, popularly known as dogfish sharks. This genus exhibits a
   conserved morphology, thus making correct morphological identification
   difficult. Considering these taxonomic problems and the scarcity of
   molecular data, the present study aimed to identify Squalus genus MOTUs,
   using DNA barcoding for species delimitation via ABGD (automatic barcode
   gap discovery), PTP (Poisson tree process), and GMYC (general mixed Yule
   coalescent) employing the mitochondrial COI gene. A total of 69
   sequences were generated from samples obtained from the American coast
   in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The ABGD analysis was the most
   conservative among the three applied delimitations, indicating three
   taxonomic units, while the PTP analysis revealed nine MOTUs, with two
   conflicting units noted between S. clarkae + S. mitsukurii and S.
   albicaudus + S. cubensis. The GMYC analysis indicated an excessive
   division, with S. acanthias and S. mitsukurii subdivided into six MOTUs
   each and S. blainville, into four. These findings demonstrated that
   Squalus presents a complex of previously defined species, with
   misidentified samples deposited in databases leading to difficulties in
   analyzing the real distribution and diversity of species belonging to
   this genus. Thus, further efforts to highlight possible new species are
   recommended.},

   (Elasmobranchii) Along the Coastal Amazon as Revealed by DNA Barcode},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},

Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Elasmobranchs represent a well-defined group, composed of about 1,150
   species inhabiting diverse aquatic environments. Currently, several of
   these species have been classified as threaten due to overexploitation.
   Therefore, we used DNA barcode to identify traded species of sharks and
   stingrays in the municipality of Braganca (Amazon coastal region), a
   major fishery landing site in northern Brazil. We collected a total of
   127 samples labeled into 24 commercial nomenclatures over 1-year period.
   Twenty species were discriminated and 13 of them are recognized under
   some threatening status. In relation to sharks, Carcharhinidae showed
   the highest number of species, half of them classified as endangered,
   followed by hammerhead sharks (Sphyrnidae), with four species also
   regarded as threatened with extinction. The Rhinopteridae and Dasyatidae
   rays were the most abundant groups, with trade records of the following
   threatened species: Rhinoptera brasiliensis, Rhinoptera bonasus, Hypanus
   berthalutzae, and Fontitrygon geijskesi. It is noteworthy that
   threatened species of elasmobranchs have been frequently and regularly
   exploited because of inefficient fishery management policies. Therefore,
   effective inspection practices need to be incorporated in fisheries,
   including the use of DNA barcode to enable a reliable method of species
   authentication and to assure the proper commercialization.},

Abstract = {Elasmobranchs are apex predators that play a crucial role in marine
   ecosystems by regulating the dynamics of food webs, as well as
   connecting different trophic levels across habitats. The large-scale
   removal of elasmobranchs impacts the energy transfer in trophic
   interactions. The pressure of unsustainable fisheries is considerable,
   as most elasmobranchs have reproductive strategies that render them
   unable to recover their demographic status after depletion. In Brazil,
   elasmobranchs are broadly commercialized under the generalist common
   name of `cacao' (namely, shark meat). This allows threatened species to
   be commercialized and makes the tracking of different species difficult.
   DNA barcoding of the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was
   applied to identify the different species sold as `cacao' along the
   coastline of Brazil. Fifty-seven samples from 33 cities in 15 coastal
   states of Brazil were purchased and analysed. Bioinformatic analyses
   revealed the presence of 17 species that were sold as `cacao'. Among
   them, Prionace glauca (blue shark) was the most abundant. Other species,
   listed as Endangered under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, were
   also uncovered as being in the shark meat trade, such as Sphyrna lewini
   (scalloped hammerhead), Isurus paucus (longfin mako shark), and Squatina
   guggenheim (angular angel shark). These findings have reinforced the
   necessity to correctly label the commercialized species. Public actions
   towards species-specific management plans must be applied, as well as
   monitoring the supervised allied educational programmes.},

Title = {Resolving the spatial distributions of Dipturus intermedius and Dipturus

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Batoid fishes are among the most endangered marine vertebrates, yet
   conservation efforts have been confounded by incomplete taxonomy.
   Evidence suggest that the critically endangered `common skate' actually
   represents two species: the flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) and the
   blue skate (Dipturus batis). However, knowledge of the geographic range
   of these two nominal species is limited. Here, DNA sequencing is used to
   distinguish these species, allowing their spatial distributions to be
   clarified. These records were also used as the basis for species
   distribution modelling, providing the first broad scale models for each
   species across the Northeast Atlantic. Samples were obtained from
   Iceland, the UK (specifically Shetland), the North Sea and the Azores.
   Results suggest that D. batis was commonly distributed in the Western
   Approaches and Celtic Sea, extending out to Rockall and Iceland. D.
   intermedius generally appears to be less abundant, but was most frequent
   around northern Scotland and Ireland, including the northern North Sea,
   and was also present in Portugal. Two individuals were also identified
   from seamounts in remote areas of the Atlantic around the Azores, the
   furthest south and west the species has been found. This supports
   reports that the flapper skate historically had a much wider
   distribution (which was also highlighted in the distribution model),
   emphasising the large scale over which fisheries may have led to
   extirpations. Furthermore, these Azorean samples shared a unique control
   region haplotype, highlighting the importance of seamounts in preserving
   genetic diversity.},

Abstract = {The illegal sale of endangered elasmobranchs has been recorded in a
   number of different Brazilian states, where sharks and rays are being
   marketed primarily as `cacao' or `viola'. Brazil is ranked among the top
   10 nations worldwide that harvest most sharks, causing an immeasurable
   impact on the local elasmobranch populations.
   The present study applied the DNA barcoding technique, based on the
   cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene, for the molecular identification of
   the elasmobranch species sold as processed products under the generic
   names of `cacao', `mangona', `azul', `cambeva', `fiuso' and `lombo
   preto', in the fish market of the city of Florianopolis, capital of the
   state of Santa Catarina, Brazil.
   Nine elasmobranch species were identified in the 56 samples analysed,
   including six sharks and three rays, representing six families, the
   Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Squatinidae, Arhynchobatidae, Myliobatidae
   and Gymnuridae. Prionace glauca, identified in more than half (56\%) of
   the samples analysed, is listed as Near Threatened by the International
   Union for the Conservation of Nature.
   Six species identified in the present study, Sphyrna zygaena, Sphyrna
   lewini, Squatina guggenheim, Carcharhinus signatus, Gymnura altavela and
   Rioraja agassizii, are under some level of risk of extinction, while two
   others (Rhizoprionodon lalandii and Myliobatis goodei) are listed as
   Data Deficient.
   Our results indicate that the commercial exploitation of endemic sharks
   and rays at risk of extinction is commonplace in southern Brazil. This
   reinforces the need for more systematic monitoring of the trade in
   fishery products and more effective application of the environmental
   legislation and conservation programmes.},

Title = {What's in a name? Phylogenetic species identification reveals extensive
   trade of endangered guitarfishes and sharks},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {257},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Fishing has a major impact on the biodiversity of elasmobranchs, a
   diverse and ancient group of fish. The illegal trade of products derived
   from endangered species is widespread and many times concealed by both
   deliberate and inadvertent mislabeling. In groups where data is sparse,
   such as guitarfishes, it is unknown which species are at a higher risk
   of extinction due to illegal trade. Brazil is currently one of the
   world's largest market for elasmobranch products, but it is uncertain
   whether the current regulatory measures are effective across all
   commercial sectors. Here, we applied molecular phylogenetics to identify
   the species sold as elasmobranchs in Rio de Janeiro. Products labeled as
   ``shark{''}, ``ray{''} and ``guitarfish{''} were sampled from
   fishmongers, supermarkets, restaurants and street markets (n = 221).
   Over 60\% of the samples were derived from threatened species, reaching
   90\% in guitarfish and 100\% in ray products. The endemic and critically
   endangered Pseudobatos horkelii was the only authentic guitarfish among
   all samples labeled as such (n = 75), all others were identified as
   threatened/endemic rays (Atlantoraja castelnaui, A. cyclophora) or
   sharks (Squatina guggenheim, S. occulta). S. guggenheim was also
   detected among the products labeled as ``sharks{''} (n = 113), as were
   five other endangered shark species: Carcharhinus falciformis, C.
   signatus, Isurus oxyrhinchus, Sphyrna zygaena and S. lewini. While no
   mislabeling was observed in supermarkets, the prevalence was high in
   local trade, indicating that regulatory and awareness-raising measures
   must be adapted to this economically and socially important sector.},

Abstract = {The chromosomes of two freshwater stingrays, Potamotrygon motoro and
   Potamotrygon sp., from the Amazon River basin in Brazil were
   investigated using integrated molecular (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1)
   and cytogenetic analyses. Potamotrygon motoro presented intraspecific
   variation in the diploid number, with 2n=66 in the females and 2n=65 in
   the males, while Potamotrygon sp. had a karyotype with 66 chromosomes,
   in both sexes. The C-banding revealed the presence of heterochromatic
   blocks accumulated in the centromeric region of all the chromosomes in
   both species. The FISH assays with 18S DNA probes highlighted the
   terminal region of three or four chromosome pairs in P. motoro and seven
   chromosomes in Potamotrygon sp. The rDNA 5S sequences were found in only
   one chromosomal pair in both species. The interspecific genetic distance
   based on the COI sequences, between P. motoro and Potamotrygon sp. from
   Amazon River was 10.8\%, while that between the Amazonian P. motoro and
   Potamotrygon amandae from the Parana River was 2.2\%, and the genetic
   distance between Potamotrygon sp. and P. amandae was 11.8\%. In addition
   to the new insights on the cytogenetics of the study species, the
   results of the present study confirmed the existence of heteromorphic
   sex-linked chromosomes in P. motoro.},

Title = {Enzymatic versatility and thermostability of a new aryl-alcohol oxidase
   from Thermothelomyces thermophilus M77},
Journal = {BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1864},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background
   Fungal aryl-alcohol oxidases (AAOx) are extracellular flavoenzymes that
   belong to glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and are
   responsible for the selective conversion of primary aromatic alcohols
   into aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding acids, with
   concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as by-product. The
   H2O2 can be provided to lignin degradation pathway, a biotechnological
   property explored in biofuel production. In the thermophilic fungus
   Thermothelomyces thermophilus (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila),
   just one AAOx was identified in the exo-proteome.
   Methods
   The glycosylated and non-refolded crystal structure of an AAOx from T.
   thermophilus at 2.6 angstrom resolution was elucidated by X-ray
   crystallography combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
   studies. Moreover, biochemical analyses were carried out to shed light
   on enzyme substrate specificity and thermostability.
   Results
   This flavoenzyme harbors a flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor and
   is able to oxidize aromatic substrates and 5-HMF. Our results also show
   that the enzyme has similar oxidation rates for bulky or simple aromatic
   substrates such as cinnamyl and veratryl alcohols. Moreover, the crystal
   structure of MtAAOx reveals an open active site, which might explain
   observed specificity of the enzyme.
   Conclusions
   MtAAOx shows previously undescribed structural differences such as a
   fully accessible catalytic tunnel, heavy glycosylation and Ca2+ binding
   site providing evidences for thermostability and activity of the enzymes
   from AA3\_2 subfamily.
   General significance
   Structural and biochemical analyses of MtAAOx could be important for
   comprehension of aryl-alcohol oxidases structure-function relationships
   and provide additional molecular tools to be used in future
   biotechnological applications.},

Abstract = {Trawling is a controversial fishing method due to the perceived lack of
   selectivity of the net and the resulting capture of a large quantity and

   and 62 families were captured, including 17 species under some degree of
   threat in the wild according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
   (IUCN). These results highlight the impact on the marine biodiversity of
   northern Brazil caused by the bycatch of small-scale industrial and
   unregulated fishery operations, and support the application of DNA-based
   methods for the identification of the bycatch species taken by data-poor
   fisheries, as a powerful tool for the improvement of the quality of
   fishery catch statistics and more precise bycatch records.},

Abstract = {The genus Menticirrhus is widely distributed in the Neotropical region,
   where its species are common and abundant in shallow coastal waters and
   estuaries. The diversity, biogeography, and evolutionary relationships
   of the Menticirrhus species are still poorly known, due primarily to the
   difficulty of differentiating the species, given the broad similarities
   in their external morphology. The present study is based on the analysis
   of morphological and molecular data, with the examination of type
   specimens and a comprehensive collection of non-type specimens from an
   ample geographic range. These analyses indicated that two widely
   distributed Western Atlantic species, Menticirrhus americanus and M.
   littoralis, represent species complexes. The M. littoralis species
   complex is characterized by the absence of dark bars on body side, and a
   smaller, light-colored pectoral fins, that barely reaching the tip of
   the depressed pelvic fins, with fewer pectoral-fin rays. This complex
   includes three species: M. littoralis, found in the Gulf of Mexico, M.
   gracilis, from the southeastern and southern coast of South America, and
   a new species, described here, from the northern to eastern Brazilian
   coast. The M. americanus species complex is characterized by the
   presence of dark bars on body side, and a large, dark pectoral fin, that
   surpass the tip of the depressed pelvic fin, with more pectoral-fin
   rays. This complex has two species, M. americanus, which occurs on the
   east coast of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico, and M.
   martinicensis, found from Caribbean to Argentina, that represents a
   cryptic allopatric species. An identification key to all species of the
   genus is presented.},

Title = {Biodiversity and conservation of marine elasmobranchs in the extreme

Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The extreme south of Brazil, Southwestern Atlantic, presents a vast and
   interesting history of elasmobranchs occurrence records. This is a
   transition zone between warm tropical waters cold regions, which
   reflects in the great species diversity, including rare occurrences and
   endemism. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the
   composition and conservation status of elasmobranchs that occurs in
   state of the Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil, through a detailed
   literature review and review lists of species deposited in regional,
   national and international collections. In total, 94 species were
   recorded (60.6\% of Brazil elasmobranch biodiversity and 8\% of the
   world), with 11 new records compared to the most recent study,
   distributed into 10 orders and 30 families. A total of 58 species of
   sharks were listed, most of them belonging to the order
   Carcharhiniformes (41.4\%), followed by Squaliformes (27.6\%), and 36
   rays mainly of the orders Rajiformes (50.0\%) and Myliobatiformes
   (30.5\%). Concerning their conservation status, 26.6, 38.3 and 45.8\% of
   the species are threatened (CR, EN, VU), at the regional, national and
   international levels, respectively. The intense fishing effort may be
   the main responsible for these results. Resumption of landings
   monitoring, inclusion of local ecological knowledge of fishermen,
   taxonomic and molecular identification of carcasses, are suggested as
   mitigating strategies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Rays (Batoidea) are among the most threatened groups of vertebrates.
   Slow growth and low fecundity make many species vulnerable to
   overfishing, but increased demand for gill rakers in traditional Chinese
   medicine and elasmobranch meat means exploitation continues. In
   response, protection has increased, with manta and devilrays (Mobulidae)
   and sawfishes (Pristidae) now listed on Convention on International
   Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This protection requires an
   accurate assay for species identification, even when parts of the body
   have been removed or products have been processed. Therefore, we
   developed and tested a new COI minibarcode to identify ray species among
   processed samples. This assay was tested on 25 samples from across four
   batoid orders and showed consistent amplification. In 68\% of cases, a
   correct top match was identified on GenBank and BOLD, but its accuracy
   should be much higher (particularly due to extensive taxonomic revisions
   in this group). Bioinformatic analysis of existing sequences also showed
   81\% of minibarcodes were matched back to a single species and 100\%
   correctly back to all other taxonomic ranks. This increased to 91\% when
   only including records published in the previous 2 years (that should
   help to account for recent taxonomic revisions). Analysis of skate
   `wings' and cooked samples was highly successful, allowing the
   unambiguous identification of species. These results suggest this
   minibarcode will be highly useful in identifying ray species and could
   have a range of applications from the analysis of processed products to
   investigations of environmental DNA, making them an effective tool in

Title = {The label ``Cacao{''} is a shark or a ray and can be a threatened
   species! Elasmobranch trade in Southern Brazil unveiled by DNA barcoding},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Sharks exhibit peculiar characteristics, which may lead to overfishing
   to cause irreversible damage to stocks and failing to restore original
   population sizes. Although global fin trade has decreased since 2000
   meat trade has increased, with Brazil figuring as the largest shark meat
   importer worldwide. Still, in Brazil, elasmobranchs are traded under the
   label ``cacao{''} making it difficult to monitor what species are
   actually being traded. To overcome elasmobranch fraudulent trade,
   molecular techniques have been developed aiding in illegal trade
   monitoring. Therefore, the objective of the present study was apply DNA
   barcoding technique (COI analysis) as a molecular support tool for the
   identification of shark species commercialized in the main fish markets
   of southern Brazil. A total of 650 base pairs (bp) of barcode COI from
   231 samples were sequenced and analyzed, identifying 16 different
   elasmobranch species, being 12 shark species and four batoid species.
   About 43.3\% of the total sampled consists of species listed in some
   IUCN risk category (e.g. Carcharias taurus, Carcharhinus falciformis,
   Sphyrna lewini, S. zygaena, Squatina gug,genheim). A key step for
   conservation would be encourage the consumer to demand the correct
   identification of the meat consumed. Such an attitude may influence the
   decision of supermarkets and fish markets to purchase only correctly
   identified products, which in turn would lead to the need for
   specialists actively and constantly working alongside fishery landings.},

Title = {Molecular identification of ray species traded along the Brazilian

Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Overfishing can lead to stock collapses of both target and bycatch
   species. In some cases, unregulated fishing activities can even drive
   species towards extinction. Batoids comprise a significant portion of
   the bycatch of fisheries targeting teleost fishes. In Brazil, the Amazon
   coast is the second largest landing area in the country for these
   organisms. The present study aimed to identify batoid species captured
   and traded along the Brazilian Amazon coast, as well as to analyze the
   batoids species most commercialized in the region by using the
   cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COI) mitochondrial gene. In total, 118
   samples were collected and nine species identified. Dasyatidae was the
   most abundant family (two genera, three species, and 52 individuals),
   followed by Aetobatidae (one genus and one species), Rhinopteridae (one
   genus, two species), and Narcinidae (one genus, one species), each with
   14 individuals. Finally, Gymnuridae and Pristidae were represented by
   one genus, one species and 12 individuals each. Threatened species, such
   as Pristis pristis and Rhinoptera brasiliensis, were found to be
   commonly traded in the fish markets. Results also pointed the presence
   of a third and undescribed Narcine species. Finally, genetic differences
   between populations of the same species were found for Hypanus guttatus,
   Aetobatus narinari, and Rhinoptera bonasus - indicating possible
   geographic and/or reproductive separations. Therefore, we reinforce the
   need of forensics research to incorporate DNA-based evidence. This
   information could support improvements on management and law enforcement
   of batoid fisheries and trade in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Statistical fisheries data are usually obtained during landings, through
   rapid fish classification and their categorization under the trade names
   given to species or groups of species. However, species classification
   is often difficult, particularly concerning elasmobranchs whose fins and
   heads have been removed, leading to labelling errors. The aim of this
   paper is to identify the ray species composition landed in south-east
   Brazil, providing identification strategies to support a plan for more
   efficient labelling and management. Samples were obtained from artisanal
   fleet landings, between November 2012 and May 2014. For taxonomic
   identification of whole or processed animals (n = 279, belonging to 10
   species), morphological, metric, and molecular techniques were employed.
   The common name used by fishermen was more related to the location where
   they lived than the fishing gear used. Morphometric analyses resulted in
   pectoral fin to length and weight conversion equations of whole
   individuals for each species, and 10 variables were found to be
   diagnostic of each genus. A genetic identification, based on sequencing
   of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase I, was
   applied to verify morphological identification. A dichotomous key that
   allowed ray identification at the species level from pectoral fin
   morphology was developed. The approach was field tested and deemed
   adequate, leading to a robust monitoring strategy for estimating the
   biomass of specific landed rays.},

Abstract = {Sharks developed life history traits that make them susceptible to
   overfishing. This is, in turn, a risk for extinction, and several
   species are affected. The high price of shark fins in the international
   trade has triggered the widespread capture of sharks at unsustainable
   levels, prompting illegal and unethical practices, such as finning. To
   address these concerns, the present study aimed to identify species
   composition using molecular techniques based on DNA barcoding and DNA
   polymorphism on samples taken from illegal shark fin seizures conducted
   by the Federal Environmental Agency of Brazil. A species-specific
   DNA-based identification from three finning seizures in Brazil found at
   least 20 species from 747 shark fins, some of which were identified as
   endangered and protected under Brazilian legislation, while others were
   representative of restricted catches, according to Appendix II of CITES.
   In the seizure from Belem, 338 fins were identified as belonging to at
   least 19 different species, while in the seizure from Natal 211, fins
   belonging to at least 8 different species were identified. Furthermore,
   198 fins from Cananeia were identified through PCR-Multiplex as
   belonging to Isurus oxyrinchus. These results raise concerns about the
   environmental and socioeconomic effects of finning on developing
   countries. Furthermore, this study represents the first finning
   evaluation from Brazil in the Southwest Atlantic, highlighting the
   importance of developing policies aimed toward restricting and
   regulating the shark trade and detecting IUU fisheries and illegal trade
   of endangered species, mainly in developing countries, where fisheries
   management, surveillance, and species-specific fisheries catch data are
   often sporatic.},

Abstract = {Today, elasmobranchs are one the most threatened vertebrate groups
   worldwide. In fact, at least 90\% of elasmobranch species are listed in
   the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List,
   while more than 40\% are data-deficient. Although these vertebrates are
   mainly affected by unsustainable fishery activities, bycatch is also one
   of the major threats to sharks and batoids worldwide, and represents a
   challenge for both sustainable fishery management and for biodiversity
   and conservational efforts. Thus, in this study, DNA barcode methodology
   was used to identify the bycatch composition of batoid species from
   small-scale industrial fisheries in the southwest Atlantic and artisanal
   fisheries from southeast Brazil. A total of 228 individuals belonging to
   four Chondrichthyes orders, seven families, and at least 17 distinct
   batoid species were sequenced; among these individuals, 131 belonged to
   species protected in Brazil, 101 to globally threatened species, and
   some to species with trade restrictions provided by Appendix II of the
   Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). These
   results highlight the impacts on marine biodiversity of bycatch by
   small-scale industrial and unmanaged artisanal fisheries from the
   southwest Atlantic, and support the implementation of DNA-based
   methodologies for species-specific identification in data-poor fisheries
   as a powerful tool for improving the quality of fisheries' catch
   statistics and for keeping precise bycatch records.},

   reinforcing the validation of the new species. The conservation status

Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {206},
Pages = {193-197},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Morphological identification in the field can be extremely difficult
   considering fragmentation of species for trade or high similarity
   between congeneric species. In this context, the shark group belonging
   to the genus Squatina is composed of three species distributed in the
   southern part of the western Atlantic. These three species are
   classified in the IUCN Red List as endangered, and they are currently
   protected under Brazilian law, which prohibits fishing and trade.
   Molecular genetic tools are now used for practical taxonomic
   identification, particularly in cases where morphological observation is
   prevented, e.g., during fish processing. Consequently, DNA barcoding was
   used in the present study to track potential crimes against the landing
   and trade of endangered species along the Sao Paulo coastline, in
   particular Squatina guggenheim (n = 75) and S. occulta (n = 5), as well
   as the Brazilian guitarfish Pseudobatos horkelii (n = 5). DNA barcoding
   revealed the continuous fishing and trafficking of these protected
   species, thus giving clear evidence that the current conservation models
   and methods of monitoring are not working.},

Abstract = {This study reports the pathogen Perkinsus beihaiensis in oysters of the
   genus Crassostrea on the coast of the State of Bahia (Brazil), its
   prevalence, infection intensity and correlation with salinity. Oysters
   (n = 240) were collected between October and December 2014 at eight
   sampling stations between latitudes 13 degrees 55'S and 15 degrees 42'S.
   The laboratory procedures included macroscopic analysis, histology,
   culture in Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM), Polymerase Chain
   Reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. PCR and sequencing have been used for
   the genetic identification of oysters as well. Two species of oysters
   have been identified: Crassostrea rhizophorae and C. brasiliana. In both
   oyster species P. beihaiensis was the only Perkinsus species detected.
   In C. rhizophorae, the average prevalence was 82.8\% by histology and
   65.2\% by RFTM. In C. brasiliana, the prevalences were 70.5\% and
   35.7\%, respectively. The higher prevalence of P. beihaiensis in C.
   rhizophorae was probably influenced by salinity, with which was
   positively correlated (r> 0.8). In both oysters, P. beihaiensis was
   located mainly in the gastric epithelium. The infection was generally
   mild or moderate, without apparent harm to the hosts, but in cases of
   severe infection, there was hemocytical reaction and tissue
   disorganization. The generally high prevalence in the region suggests
   that oysters should be monitored with respect to this pathogen,
   especially in growing areas.},

Title = {Molecular Identification of Shark Meat From Local Markets in Southern
   Brazil Based on DNA Barcoding: Evidence for Mislabeling and Trade of
   Endangered Species},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Elasmobranchs, the group of cartilaginous fishes that include sharks and
   rays, are especially vulnerable to overfishing due to low fecundity and
   late sexual maturation. A significant number of elasmobranch species are
   currently overexploited or threatened by fisheries activities.
   Additionally, several recent reports have indicated that there has been
   a reduction in regional elasmobranch population sizes. Brazil is an
   important player in elasmobranch fisheries and one of the largest
   importers of shark meat. However, carcasses entering the shark meat
   market have usually had their fins and head removed, which poses a
   challenge to reliable species identification based on the morphology of
   captured individuals. This is further complicated by the fact that the
   internal Brazilian market trades several different elasmobranch species
   under a common popular name: ``cacao.{''} The use of such imprecise
   nomenclature, even among governmental agencies, is problematic for both
   controlling the negative effects of shark consumption and informing the
   consumer about the origins of the product. In this study, we used DNA
   barcoding (mtDNA, COI gene) to identify, at the species level,
   ``cacao{''} samples available in local markets from Southern Brazil. We
   collected 63 samples traded as ``cacao,{''} which we found to correspond
   to 20 different species. These included two teleost species: Xiphias
   gladius (n = 1) and Genidens barbus (n = 6), and 18 species from seven
   elasmobranch orders (Carcharhiniformes, n = 42; Squaliformes, n = 3;
   Squatiniformes, n = 2; Rhinopristiformes, n = 4; Myliobatiformes, n = 3;
   Rajiformes, n = 1; and Torpediniformes, n = 1). The most common species
   in our sample were Prionace glauca (n = 15) and Sphyrna lewini (n = 14),
   while all other species were represented by four samples or less.
   Considering IUCN criteria, 47\% of the elasmobranch species found are
   threatened at the global level, while 53\% are threatened and 47\% are
   critically endangered in Brazil. These results underline that labeling
   the meat of any shark species as ``cacao{''} is problematic for
   monitoring catch allocations from the fishing industry and discourages
   consumer engagement in conservationist practices through informed
   decision-making.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Here, we report trading of endangered shark species in a world hotspot
   for elasmobranch conservation in Brazil. Data on shark fisheries are
   scarce in Brazil, although the northern and northeastern regions have
   the highest indices of shark bycatch. Harvest is made primarily with
   processed carcasses lacking head and fins, which hampers reliable
   species identification and law enforcement on illegal catches. We used
   partial sequences of two mitochondrial genes (COI and/or NADH2) to
   identify 17 shark species from 427 samples being harvested and marketed
   on the northern coast of Brazil. Nine species (53\%) are listed under
   some extinction threat category according to Brazilian law and
   international authorities (IUCN - International Union for Conservation
   of Nature; CITES - Convention on International Trade of Endangered
   Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The number increases to 13 (76\%) if
   we also consider the Near Threatened category. Hammerhead sharks are
   under threat worldwide, and composed 18.7\% of samples, with Sphyrna
   mokarran being the fourth most common species among samples. As illegal
   trade of threatened shark species is a worldwide conservation problem,
   molecular identification of processed meat or specimens lacking
   diagnostic body parts is a highly effective tool for species
   identification and law enforcement.},

Title = {A contribution to the identification of charcoal origin in Brazil III:
   microscopic identification of 10 Cerrado species},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {255-264},
Abstract = {Brazil has one of the richest biodiversities in the world. The Brazilian
   savanna is a hotspot for conservation priorities and its deforestation
   is of global concern. Conservation in this biome is threatened by
   unsustainable use of forests, such as illegal logging for charcoal
   production. Thus, government agents need to verify whether charcoal
   loads follow the Document of Forestry Origin (DOF). To improve charcoal
   identification, our study presents the microscopic description of 10
   Cerrado species and provides an identification key to aid government
   agents during surveillance. We analysed charcoal samples with a scanning
   electron microscope. The method of carbonisation simulated real
   conditions. Wechose species with similar wood anatomy (sparse axial
   parenchyma and narrow rays), which increases misidentification by forest
   controllers because of their difficulty to identify these features.
   Also, paratracheal scanty, diffuse and diffuse-in-aggregates parenchyma
   were harder to recognise in charcoal than in wood. Other features, such
   as vessels, rays and abundant axial parenchyma, were easily identified.
   The present work can be used as a part of a charcoal anatomy database
   focussed on preventing deforestation in Brazil and in other countries
   with similar problems.},

Abstract = {The Elasmobranchii comprises the diverse and important group of sharks
   and rays. The group includes some of the ocean's largest predatory
   fishes, suffering unsustainable fishing activities and is commercially
   overexploited for their meat and fins. Overfishing has resulted in
   significant population declines and several species are now considered
   under high threat and facing extinction, with about 93\% of its nominal
   species included in the IUCN Red List. Molecular data have provided
   important information about these species, allowing the management of
   natural stocks and preventing their decline. Population genetics and
   connectivity data knowledge are now available and play an important role
   on establishing conservation policies. However, despite the ecological,
   commercial and conservation importance, no molecular method is available
   to identify sharks and rays in a forensic context. Following the
   development of the Shark Panel v1.0 which includes uniquely sharks, now
   we tested the effectiveness of the v2.0 multiplex on batoid
   elasmobranchs. We carried out a systematic molecular analysis using 85
   previously published mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from
   the NCBI database and found that indels in the 16S rRNA gene can be used
   to distinguish several analyzed species, including some of the most
   threatened according to IUCN Red List. The regions selected in this
   study can be used for the construction of molecular identification
   assays.},

Abstract = {A new species of trichomycterid catfish, Trichomycterus pascuali, is
   described from Paranapanema basin and is distinguished from all
   congeners by the possession of five pectoral-fin rays and the absence of
   pelvic fin, girdle, and muscles. Additional features further
   differentiate the new species from the other congeners lacking pelvic
   fins, T. candidus, T. catamarcensis, and T. tropeiro. The identification
   of T. pascuali is additionally corroborated by genetic divergence based
   on DNA-barcode analysis. Osteological and myological data unequivocally
   support the inclusion of the new species in the Trichomycterinae and
   molecular analyses justify its allocation to the genus Trichomycterus
   rather than Eremophilus, a trichomycterine taxon traditionally diagnosed
   by the lack of pelvic fins. Our genetic analysis further indicates that
   pelvic fins were independently lost in E. mutisii, T. candidus, and T.
   pascuali.},

   PCR methodology based on species-specific primers for the precise
   identification of samples from the daggernose shark (body parts and
   fins). The effectiveness of the method was verified through application
   for analysis of unidentified shark samples collected in fish markets and
   a worldwide inventory of over 57 shark species. This reliable molecular
   system of identification combines the advantages of low cost and high
   throughput and may be used locally to monitor the capture and trade of
   this Critically Endangered shark species.},

Title = {Human identification through frontal sinus 3D superimposition: Pilot
   study with Cone Beam Computer Tomography},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {63-69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As a unique anatomical feature of the human body, the frontal sinus
   morphology has been used for identification of unknown bodies with many
   techniques, mostly using 2D postero-anterior X-rays. With the increase
   of the use of Cone-Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT), the availability of
   this exam as antemortem records should be considered. The purpose of
   this study is to establish a new technique for frontal sinus
   identification through direct superimposition of 3D volumetric models
   obtained from CBCT exam, by testing two distinct situations. First, a
   reproducibility test, where two observers independently rendered models
   of frontal sinus from a sample 20 CBCT exams and identified them on each
   other's list. In the second situation, one observer tested the protocol
   and established on different exams of three individual. Using the open
   source DICOM viewer InVesallius (R) for rendering, Mesh Lab (R), for
   positioning the models and CloudCompare for volumetric comparison, both
   observers matched cases with 100\% accuracy and the level of coincidence
   in a identification situation. The uniqueness of the frontal sinus
   topography is remarkable and through the described technique, can be
   used in forensic as an identification method whenever both the sinus
   structure and antemortem computer tomography is available. (C) 2015

Title = {PCR-RFLP analysis to identify four ray species of the genus Dasyatis
   (Elasmobranchii, Dasyatidae) fished along the southeastern and southern
   coast of Brazil},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Fisheries statistics and stock assessment of many species of rays have
   been limited by the lack of information at the species level. Given the
   difficulty in identifying the four species within genus Dasyatis found
   in southeastern and southern Brazil, the aim of this work was to develop
   a methodology based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I
   (COI) gene to distinguish and register the capture frequencies of these
   species. Amplification of the COI region was performed using universal
   fish R1 and F2 primers, which generated amplicons of approximately 650
   bp that subsequently were sequenced. The FokI restriction enzyme was
   selected and generated specific DNA fragments for each species, with two
   fragments for Dasyatis hypostigma (390 and 260 bp), three fragments for
   Dasyatis americana (300, 180 and 155 bp), two fragments for Dasyatis
   guttata (370 and 300 bp), and two fragments for Dasyatis centroura (410
   and 200 bp). The same enzyme then was used to identify 97 samples of ray
   carcass tissues collected from fishery landings, and revealed a species
   occurrence of 90.7\% for D. hypostigma, 5.1\% for D. americana, 2.1\%
   for D. guttata, and 2.1\% for D. centroura. Thus, the PCR-RFLP technique
   can be used to efficiently identify these four species and serves as an
   indicator of the current catch rates. Moreover, the method can help
   solve misidentification problems and can be used routinely to monitor
   landings and to establish and implement plans for fishery management.

   Consumption in Southern Brazil},
Journal = {ETHNOBIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {In Brazil, the demand for sustainably certified seafood is increasing
   and retailers have promised to source all seafood from sustainable
   sources by 2015. In the southern portion of the country, elasmobranch
   meat is sold as cacao, and consumers are often unaware that cacao refers
   to any type of elasmobranch. The present study used questionnaires to
   investigate the lay public's knowledge of elasmobranch meat sold in a
   Brazilian city. Shoppers were surveyed at supermarkets in Curitiba, the
   largest city in southern Brazil. The study revealed that people do not
   link commercialized cacao meat to sharks and rays (Elasmobranchii), with
   more than half of respondents who claimed to have already eaten cacao
   did not think they had ever eaten shark or ray. The educational profile
   of interviewees suggests that this lack of knowledge may be even more
   common in other segments of Brazilian society. Therefore, we suggest
   that ecological information about elasmobranchs should be included in
   Brazilian elementary and high school curricula. Such a measure has the
   potential to modify behavior, create awareness, and stimulate
   responsibility throughout society, with the primary goal of reducing
   shark meat consumption and, ultimately, guaranteeing the long term
   conservation of marine resources.},

Abstract = {Despite the widespread distribution of Cercopithifilaria bainae among
   canine and tick populations worldwide, this filarioid is currently
   considered of `minor importance' in veterinary medicine, particularly
   when compared to related filarioids, such as Dirofilaria immitis and
   Dirofilaria repens. To date, only a single case of dermatological
   alterations possibly associated to infection by C bainae had been
   reported in a dog. In the present study, we describe the first case of
   systemic alterations associated to C bainae infection in a dog suffering
   from diffused chronic polyarthritis. The animal had a previous history
   of reluctance to move and stiff gait and displayed multiple joint pain
   during manipulation of limbs. No biochemical, haematological and X-ray
   alterations were detected; microfilariae were observed in the synovial
   fluids collected from the joints. In spite of the morphological and
   molecular identification of these microfilariae as C. bainae, the dog
   did not respond to multiple microfilaricidal treatments with milbemicyn
   oxyme. The potential role of C. bainae in the pathogenesis of this
   clinical condition is discussed. Given the potential pathogenicity of
   this parasite, improved knowledge of this little known tick-borne
   nematode is warranted in order to assist the development of novel and
   effective treatment strategies. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Pristis perotteti, the largetooth sawfish, is one of most endangered
   elasmobranchs because of fisheries and habitat degradation. Its
   commercialization in Brazil is prohibited, but fresh or salted fillets

   Based on partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial 16S and Cyt b genes,
   24 (55\%) out of 44 samples were unequivocally identified as P.
   perotteti while the others comprised eight species of the families
   Carcharhinidae and Ginglymostomatidae. These results show that fishing
   surveillance and monitoring have not been effective to prohibit the

   `machote' (small size) in Brazil, were captured by the tuna fleet at the
   Santos and Guaruja fishery ports on the southeastern coast of Brazil and
   identified at the species level by multiplex PCR. The Internal
   Transcribed Spacer 2 region of ribosomal DNA was amplified using
   universal primers, and species-specific primers were used for some of
   the Carcharhinus species. A total of 313 shark carcasses were directly
   identified by multiplex PCR. Four carcass samples did not amplify;
   therefore, the partial COI sequences were used to confirm their
   taxonomic identity. The results show that more than one species was

Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {Obtaining accurate species-specific landings data is an essential step
   toward achieving sustainable shark fisheries. Globally distributed
   sharpnose sharks (genus Rhizoprionodon) exhibit life-history
   characteristics (rapid growth, early maturity, annual reproduction) that
   suggests that they could be fished in a sustainable manner assuming an
   investment in monitoring, assessment and careful management. However,
   obtaining species-specific landings data for sharpnose sharks is
   problematic because they are morphologically very similar to one
   another. Moreover, sharpnose sharks may also be confused with other
   small sharks (either small species or juveniles of large species) once
   they are processed (i.e., the head and fins are removed). Here we
   present a highly streamlined molecular genetics approach based on seven
   species-specific PCR primers in a multiplex format that can
   simultaneously discriminate body parts from the seven described
   sharpnose shark species commonly occurring in coastal fisheries
   worldwide. The species-specific primers are based on nucleotide sequence
   differences among species in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed
   spacer 2 locus (ITS2). This approach also distinguishes sharpnose sharks
   from a wide range of other sharks (52 species) and can therefore assist
   in the regulation of coastal shark fisheries around the world.},

Abstract = {Among the diverse species of guitarfish, Rhinobatos horkelii is endemic
   to the south-west Atlantic and is primarily found off the Brazilian
   coast. The IUCN has classified this species as being in critical danger
   of extinction owing to widespread exploitation. Currently, this species
   is protected under Brazilian conservation laws. However, the
   morphological similarity of R. horkelii to other species precludes
   effective protection from fishing. Guitarfish samples were obtained from
   fishermen in different regions along the Brazilian coast and were
   identified using a genetic forensic method (multiplex-PCR). The analysis
   showed that 56\% of the samples analysed were from R. horkelii, 25\%
   from Rhinobatos percellens and 19\% from Zapteryx brevirostris
   confirming that R. horkelii continues to be caught, despite conservation
   legislation. These results stress the need for effective conservation
   measures and may help to alert others to the occurrence of R. horkelii
   poaching. In addition, this work aims to establish an effective method
   of species identification to help prevent poaching of protected species
   such as R. horkelii. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {We investigated a reported case of stingray Dasyatis americana
   misidentification not detected in a published study using the random
   amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. If the referred specimen
   (landed by fisheries in Ceara, northeastern Brazil) was misidentified
   (as Dasyatis centroura) in the field, why did its RAPD data fail to
   clarify the mistake? Was it due to limitations of RAPD markers or
   perhaps to a taxonomic issue? Contrary to our initial expectations,
   neither of these hindered the detection of the misidentification. After
   reanalyzing the primary genetic data associated with the misidentified
   specimen (PCR gel photographs and/or matrices of presence/absence of
   markers for six RAPD primers), we found that the RAPD markers were
   sufficient to correctly assign the misidentified specimen to its proper
   species identity. In the original study, the specimen misidentification
   was neither noticed by the authors nor apparent in the published article
   due to how their results were interpreted and presented.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Fungal infections in human skin, such as sporotrichosis,
   can occur after fish induced trauma. This work aimed to identify fungi
   in freshwater fish that are pathogenic to humans. Methods: Extraction of
   dental arches from Serrassalmus maculatus (piranha) and Hoplias
   malabaricus (wolf fish), stings from Pimelodus maculatus (mandis
   catfish), dorsal fin rays from Plagioscion spp. (corvina) and Tilapia
   spp., for culture in Mycosel agar. Some cultures were submitted to DNA
   extraction for molecular identification by sequencing ITS-5.8S rDNA.
   Results: Cultures identified most yeast as Candida spp., while
   sequencing also permitted the identification of Phoma spp. and Yarrowia
   lipolytica. Conclusions: While the search for S. schenckii was negative,
   the presence of fungus of the genera Phoma and Candida revealed the
   pathogenic potential of this infection route. The genus Phoma is
   involved in certain forms of phaeohyphomycosis, a subcutaneous mycosis
   caused by dematiaceous fungi, with reports of infections in human organs
   and systems. Traumatizing structures of some freshwater fish present
   pathogenic fungi and this may be an important infection route that must
   be considered in some regions of Brazil, since there are a large number
   of a fisherman in constant contact with traumatogenic fish.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, because of the constant increase in the capture and trade of
   sharks all over the world and reports of several species already showing
   important signs of over-exploitation, the establishment of registration

   techniques of genetic identification through the molecular markers are
   considered essential tools for fishery monitoring. In this study, we
   present a method of multiplex-PCR, based on the gene Cytochrome Oxidase

   identification of nine species of lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks,

Abstract = {Rhinobatos percellens, Rhinobatos horkelli and Zapteryx brevirostris,
   known as guitarfish, are commonly found inshore and caught by trawl
   nets. Recently, these species have been suffering sharp population
   declines. One of the main impediments to the development of conservation
   plans is the lack of information related to each species catch.
   Gathering this information is made more difficult by the fishermen's
   practice of removing parts of the animals before landing, as well as the
   morphological similarities among the three species. To address these
   issues, this work presents multiplex-PCR protocols that were developed
   to distinguish among these species using their genetic characteristics.},

Abstract = {The ongoing decline in abundance and diversity of shark stocks,
   primarily due to uncontrolled fishery exploitation, is a worldwide
   problem. An additional problem for the development of conservation and
   management programmes is the identification of species diversity within
   a given area, given the morphological similarities among shark species,
   and the typical disembarkation of processed carcasses which are almost
   impossible to differentiate. The main aim of the present study was to
   identify those shark species being exploited off northern Brazil, by
   using the 12S-16S molecular marker. For this, DNA sequences were
   obtained from 122 specimens collected on the docks and the fish market
   in Braganca, in the Brazilian state of Para. We identified at least 11
   species. Three-quarters of the specimens collected were either
   Carcharhinus porosus or Rhizoprionodon sp, while a notable absence was
   the daggernose shark, Isogomphodon oxyrhyncus, previously one of the
   most common species in local catches. The study emphasises the value of
   molecular techniques for the identification of cryptic shark species,
   and the potential of the 12S-16S marker as a tool for phylogenetic
   inferences in a study of elasmobranchs.},

Abstract = {Sharks are suffering from intensive exploitation by worldwide fisheries
   leading to a severe decline in several populations in the last decades.
   The lack of biological data on a species-specific basis, associated with
   a k-strategist life history make it difficult to correctly manage and
   conserve these animals. The aim of the present study was to develop a
   DNA-based procedure to discriminate shark species by means of a rapid,
   low cost and easily applicable PCR analysis based on 5S rDNA repeat
   units amplification, in order to contribute conservation management of
   these animals. The generated agarose electrophoresis band patterns
   allowed to unequivocally distinguish eight shark species. The data
   showed for the first time that a simple PCR is able to discriminate
   elasmobranch species. The described 5S rDNA PCR approach generated
   species-specific genetic markers that should find broad application in
   fishery management and trade of sharks and their subproducts.},

Abstract = {Aluminum-nitrogen thin films have been obtained under well-controlled
   conditions by ion-beam-assisted deposition (IBAD). The films were
   deposited on crystalline silicon and sapphire substrates at relative low
   temperature (similar to325 K). Taking advantage of the ion energy
   control provided by the IBAD technique, the films were prepared with
   N-2(+) ions with energies ranging from 100 to 300 eV. After deposition,
   the films were investigated by in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
   ex situ by optical spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. Detailed Raman
   scattering measurements in the 100-2500 cm(-1) wave number range were
   also performed revealing interesting features related to the atomic
   composition and structure of the films. The Raman data suggest that a
   misidentification of some vibration modes can lead to incorrect
   interpretations of the crystalline quality of aluminum-nitrogen films.
   Finally, the results indicate the suitability of IBAD to produce
   crystalline AlN films at considerably lower temperatures. (C) 2002
