abstract={The raw materials of licorice root in the commerce consist of roots and/or rhizomes (stolons) of different species of Glycyrrhiza. Licorice products and raw materials are frequently mislabeled and often have mixed, misidentified, or unidentified species and parts. This paper provides a detailed comparative analysis of the morpho-anatomies of the rhizomes and roots of five species of Glycyrrhiza, namely G. glabra, G. uralensis, G. echinata, G. inflata, and G. lepidota, by bright-field light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The studied species showed some similarities in their basic anatomical features due to the fact that they are phylogenetically closely related and belong to the same genus. However, differences in microscopic features such as the thickness of cork and medullary rays, pore frequency, and size of the vessels were observed. The rhizomes can readily be distinguished by the presence of a distinct pith. The roots lack a well-defined pith and instead have primary xylem in the center. © The Author(s), 2022.

abstract={Elasmobranchs are apex predators that play a crucial role in marine ecosystems by regulating the dynamics of food webs, as well as connecting different trophic levels across habitats. The large-scale removal of elasmobranchs impacts the energy transfer in trophic interactions. The pressure of unsustainable fisheries is considerable, as most elasmobranchs have reproductive strategies that render them unable to recover their demographic status after depletion. In Brazil, elasmobranchs are broadly commercialized under the generalist common name of ‘cação’ (namely, shark meat). This allows threatened species to be commercialized and makes the tracking of different species difficult. DNA barcoding of the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was applied to identify the different species sold as ‘cação’ along the coastline of Brazil. Fifty-seven samples from 33 cities in 15 coastal states of Brazil were purchased and analysed. Bioinformatic analyses revealed the presence of 17 species that were sold as ‘cação’. Among them, Prionace glauca (blue shark) was the most abundant. Other species, listed as Endangered under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, were also uncovered as being in the shark meat trade, such as Sphyrna lewini (scalloped hammerhead), Isurus paucus (longfin mako shark), and Squatina guggenheim (angular angel shark). These findings have reinforced the necessity to correctly label the commercialized species. Public actions towards species-specific management plans must be applied, as well as monitoring the supervised allied educational programmes. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Batoid fishes are among the most endangered marine vertebrates, yet conservation efforts have been confounded by incomplete taxonomy. Evidence suggest that the critically endangered ‘common skate’ actually represents two species: the flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) and the blue skate (Dipturus batis). However, knowledge of the geographic range of these two nominal species is limited. Here, DNA sequencing is used to distinguish these species, allowing their spatial distributions to be clarified. These records were also used as the basis for species distribution modelling, providing the first broad scale models for each species across the Northeast Atlantic. Samples were obtained from Iceland, the UK (specifically Shetland), the North Sea and the Azores. Results suggest that D. batis was commonly distributed in the Western Approaches and Celtic Sea, extending out to Rockall and Iceland. D. intermedius generally appears to be less abundant, but was most frequent around northern Scotland and Ireland, including the northern North Sea, and was also present in Portugal. Two individuals were also identified from seamounts in remote areas of the Atlantic around the Azores, the furthest south and west the species has been found. This supports reports that the flapper skate historically had a much wider distribution (which was also highlighted in the distribution model), emphasising the large scale over which fisheries may have led to extirpations. Furthermore, these Azorean samples shared a unique control region haplotype, highlighting the importance of seamounts in preserving genetic diversity. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The illegal sale of endangered elasmobranchs has been recorded in a number of different Brazilian states, where sharks and rays are being marketed primarily as ‘cação’ or ‘viola’. Brazil is ranked among the top 10 nations worldwide that harvest most sharks, causing an immeasurable impact on the local elasmobranch populations. The present study applied the DNA barcoding technique, based on the cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene, for the molecular identification of the elasmobranch species sold as processed products under the generic names of ‘cação’, ‘mangona’, ‘azul’, ‘cambeva’, ‘fiuso’ and ‘lombo preto’, in the fish market of the city of Florianópolis, capital of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Nine elasmobranch species were identified in the 56 samples analysed, including six sharks and three rays, representing six families, the Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Squatinidae, Arhynchobatidae, Myliobatidae and Gymnuridae. Prionace glauca, identified in more than half (56%) of the samples analysed, is listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Six species identified in the present study, Sphyrna zygaena, Sphyrna lewini, Squatina guggenheim, Carcharhinus signatus, Gymnura altavela and Rioraja agassizii, are under some level of risk of extinction, while two others (Rhizoprionodon lalandii and Myliobatis goodei) are listed as Data Deficient. Our results indicate that the commercial exploitation of endemic sharks and rays at risk of extinction is commonplace in southern Brazil. This reinforces the need for more systematic monitoring of the trade in fishery products and more effective application of the environmental legislation and conservation programmes. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Fishing has a major impact on the biodiversity of elasmobranchs, a diverse and ancient group of fish. The illegal trade of products derived from endangered species is widespread and many times concealed by both deliberate and inadvertent mislabeling. In groups where data is sparse, such as guitarfishes, it is unknown which species are at a higher risk of extinction due to illegal trade. Brazil is currently one of the world's largest market for elasmobranch products, but it is uncertain whether the current regulatory measures are effective across all commercial sectors. Here, we applied molecular phylogenetics to identify the species sold as elasmobranchs in Rio de Janeiro. Products labeled as “shark”, “ray” and “guitarfish” were sampled from fishmongers, supermarkets, restaurants and street markets (n = 221). Over 60% of the samples were derived from threatened species, reaching 90% in guitarfish and 100% in ray products. The endemic and critically endangered Pseudobatos horkelii was the only authentic guitarfish among all samples labeled as such (n = 75), all others were identified as threatened/endemic rays (Atlantoraja castelnaui, A. cyclophora) or sharks (Squatina guggenheim, S. occulta). S. guggenheim was also detected among the products labeled as “sharks” (n = 113), as were five other endangered shark species: Carcharhinus falciformis, C. signatus, Isurus oxyrhinchus, Sphyrna zygaena and S. lewini. While no mislabeling was observed in supermarkets, the prevalence was high in local trade, indicating that regulatory and awareness-raising measures must be adapted to this economically and socially important sector. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The skate genus Atlantoraja is composed of three species (A. castelnaui, A. cyclophora, and A. platana) which differ from the other Riorajini species, Rioraja agassizii, in regards to their clasper features, squamation and presence of a caudal fin. Despite of being distributed along Southwestern Atlantic and commonly captured by fisheries in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, detailed accounts on external and internal morphology are scarce and the taxonomic status of Atlantoraja species was not revised so far. The aim of this study, therefore, is to review the taxonomy of the genus Atlantoraja, updating information on type specimens and clarifying misidentifications among species, and to describe in detail anatomical structures such as neurocranium, visceral arches, pelvic girdle, dermal denticles and teeth. Lectotypes and paralectotypes are designated for Atlantoraja castelnaui and A. cyclophora. Notes on intraspecific variation within species are also provided. Atlantoraja cyclophora and A. platana are more similar to each other than to A. castelnaui in regards to the squamation (body dorsal surface smooth vs. densely covered by prickles) and color pattern of body dorsal surface, position of orbital foramina, overall shape of neucrocranium and body measurements. Lastly, we discuss the morphological differences among species of Atlantoraja and recommend the inclusion of characters presented here in future cladistic analyses. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Bacterial communities of two critically endangered rays from the South Atlantic, the butterfly ray (Gymnura altavela) and the groovebelly ray (Dasyatis hypostigma), were described using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding.

The results revealed potentially antibiotic-producing bacterial groups on the skin of rays from the natural environment, and some taxa with the potential to benefit ray health, mainly in rays from the natural environment, as well as possible pathogens to other animals, including fish and humans. Differences were observed between the G. altavela and D. hypostigma bacteria composition, as well as between the skin and stinger bacterial composition. The bacterial community associated with D. hypostigma changed with the age of the ray. The aquarium environment severely impacted the G. altavela bacteria composition, which changed from a complex bacterial community to one dominated almost exclusively by two taxa, Oceanimonas sp. and Sediminibacterium sp. on the skin and stinger, respectively. © 2020 The Authors.

Slow growth and low fecundity make many species vulnerable to overfishing, but increased demand for gill rakers in traditional Chinese medicine and elasmobranch meat means exploitation continues. In response, protection has increased, with manta and devilrays (Mobulidae) and sawfishes (Pristidae) now listed on Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This protection requires an accurate assay for species identification, even when parts of the body have been removed or products have been processed. Therefore, we developed and tested a new COI minibarcode to identify ray species among processed samples. This assay was tested on 25 samples from across four batoid orders and showed consistent amplification. In 68% of cases, a correct top match was identified on GenBank and BOLD, but its accuracy should be much higher (particularly due to extensive taxonomic revisions in this group). Bioinformatic analysis of existing sequences also showed 81% of minibarcodes were matched back to a single species and 100% correctly back to all other taxonomic ranks. This increased to 91% when only including records published in the previous 2 years (that should help to account for recent taxonomic revisions). Analysis of skate ‘wings’ and cooked samples was highly successful, allowing the unambiguous identification of species. These results suggest this minibarcode will be highly useful in identifying ray species and could have a range of applications from the analysis of processed products to investigations of environmental DNA, making them an effective tool in the conservation of endangered batoids. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Background Fungal aryl-alcohol oxidases (AAOx) are extracellular flavoenzymes that belong to glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and are responsible for the selective conversion of primary aromatic alcohols into aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding acids, with concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as by-product. The H2O2 can be provided to lignin degradation pathway, a biotechnological property explored in biofuel production. In the thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophilus (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila), just one AAOx was identified in the exo-proteome. Methods The glycosylated and non-refolded crystal structure of an AAOx from T. thermophilus at 2.6 Å resolution was elucidated by X-ray crystallography combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies. Moreover, biochemical analyses were carried out to shed light on enzyme substrate specificity and thermostability. Results This flavoenzyme harbors a flavin adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor and is able to oxidize aromatic substrates and 5-HMF. Our results also show that the enzyme has similar oxidation rates for bulky or simple aromatic substrates such as cinnamyl and veratryl alcohols. Moreover, the crystal structure of MtAAOx reveals an open active site, which might explain observed specificity of the enzyme. Conclusions MtAAOx shows previously undescribed structural differences such as a fully accessible catalytic tunnel, heavy glycosylation and Ca2+ binding site providing evidences for thermostability and activity of the enzymes from AA3_2 subfamily. General significance Structural and biochemical analyses of MtAAOx could be important for comprehension of aryl-alcohol oxidases structure-function relationships and provide additional molecular tools to be used in future biotechnological applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The extreme south of Brazil, Southwestern Atlantic, presents a vast and interesting history of elasmobranchs occurrence records. This is a transition zone between warm tropical waters cold regions, which reflects in the great species diversity, including rare occurrences and endemism. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the composition and conservation status of elasmobranchs that occurs in state of the Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil, through a detailed literature review and review lists of species deposited in regional, national and international collections. In total, 94 species were recorded (60.6% of Brazil elasmobranch biodiversity and 8% of the world), with 11 new records compared to the most recent study, distributed into 10 orders and 30 families. A total of 58 species of sharks were listed, most of them belonging to the order Carcharhiniformes (41.4%), followed by Squaliformes (27.6%), and 36 rays mainly of the orders Rajiformes (50.0%) and Myliobatiformes (30.5%). Concerning their conservation status, 26.6, 38.3 and 45.8% of the species are threatened (CR, EN, VU), at the regional, national and international levels, respectively. The intense fishing effort may be the main responsible for these results. Resumption of landings monitoring, inclusion of local ecological knowledge of fishermen, taxonomic and molecular identification of carcasses, are suggested as mitigating strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sharks exhibit peculiar characteristics, which may lead to overfishing to cause irreversible damage to stocks and failing to restore original population sizes. Although global fin trade has decreased since 2000 meat trade has increased, with Brazil figuring as the largest shark meat importer worldwide. Still, in Brazil, elasmobranchs are traded under the label “cação” making it difficult to monitor what species are actually being traded. To overcome elasmobranch fraudulent trade, molecular techniques have been developed aiding in illegal trade monitoring. Therefore, the objective of the present study was apply DNA barcoding technique (COI analysis) as a molecular support tool for the identification of shark species commercialized in the main fish markets of southern Brazil. A total of 650 base pairs (bp) of barcode COI from 231 samples were sequenced and analyzed, identifying 16 different elasmobranch species, being 12 shark species and four batoid species. About 43.3% of the total sampled consists of species listed in some IUCN risk category (e.g. Carcharias taurus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Sphyrna lewini, S. zygaena, Squatina guggenheim). A key step for conservation would be encourage the consumer to demand the correct identification of the meat consumed. Such an attitude may influence the decision of supermarkets and fish markets to purchase only correctly identified products, which in turn would lead to the need for specialists actively and constantly working alongside fishery landings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Overfishing can lead to stock collapses of both target and bycatch species. In some cases, unregulated fishing activities can even drive species towards extinction. Batoids comprise a significant portion of the bycatch of fisheries targeting teleost fishes. In Brazil, the Amazon coast is the second largest landing area in the country for these organisms. The present study aimed to identify batoid species captured and traded along the Brazilian Amazon coast, as well as to analyze the batoids species most commercialized in the region by using the cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COI) mitochondrial gene. In total, 118 samples were collected and nine species identified. Dasyatidae was the most abundant family (two genera, three species, and 52 individuals), followed by Aetobatidae (one genus and one species), Rhinopteridae (one genus, two species), and Narcinidae (one genus, one species), each with 14 individuals. Finally, Gymnuridae and Pristidae were represented by one genus, one species and 12 individuals each. Threatened species, such as Pristis pristis and Rhinoptera brasiliensis, were found to be commonly traded in the fish markets. Results also pointed the presence of a third and undescribed Narcine species. Finally, genetic differences between populations of the same species were found for Hypanus guttatus, Aetobatus narinari, and Rhinoptera bonasus - indicating possible geographic and/or reproductive separations. Therefore, we reinforce the need of forensics research to incorporate DNA-based evidence. This information could support improvements on management and law enforcement of batoid fisheries and trade in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Statistical fisheries data are usually obtained during landings, through rapid fish classification and their categorization under the trade names given to species or groups of species. However, species classification is often difficult, particularly concerning elasmobranchs whose fins and heads have been removed, leading to labelling errors. The aim of this paper is to identify the ray species composition landed in south-east Brazil, providing identification strategies to support a plan for more efficient labelling and management. Samples were obtained from artisanal fleet landings, between November 2012 and May 2014. For taxonomic identification of whole or processed animals (n = 279, belonging to 10 species), morphological, metric, and molecular techniques were employed. The common name used by fishermen was more related to the location where they lived than the fishing gear used. Morphometric analyses resulted in pectoral fin to length and weight conversion equations of whole individuals for each species, and 10 variables were found to be diagnostic of each genus. A genetic identification, based on sequencing of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase I, was applied to verify morphological identification. A dichotomous key that allowed ray identification at the species level from pectoral fin morphology was developed. The approach was field tested and deemed adequate, leading to a robust monitoring strategy for estimating the biomass of specific landed rays. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The Blue Shark (Prionace glauca, Linnaeus, 1758) is one of the most abundant sharks in the epipelagic zone (0–200 m) and its population is distributed in oceans of tropical and temperate climate. Currently, these animals have been considered predatory fishing target and are classified as low-risk or near-endangered, according to the Red List of International Union for the Conservation Nature (IUCN). Aiming study conservation aspects of the specie, the purpose of this study is verifying the occurrence of population under-structuring in Prionace glauca. This study was started by analysis of control region of mitochondrial DNA sequences of 254 Prionace glauca individuals, obtained from the Genbank database, as well as new sequences obtained from laboratory. The second step, sequencing of another 16 individuals of the same specie was made and added to the database for a new comparison. From the current results, we can verify that there are haplotypic difference in individuals of the same species, indicating that they belong to distinct lineages. The difference observed between haplotypes indicates that there is a great migratory potential of this specie. This study will be extended with a larger number of samples and the inclusion of nuclear markers, aiming at a better understanding of the processes that act at the population level. © 2019},

abstract={Sharks developed life history traits that make them susceptible to overfishing. This is, in turn, a risk for extinction, and several species are affected. The high price of shark fins in the international trade has triggered the widespread capture of sharks at unsustainable levels, prompting illegal and unethical practices, such as finning. To address these concerns, the present study aimed to identify species composition using molecular techniques based on DNA barcoding and DNA polymorphism on samples taken from illegal shark fin seizures conducted by the Federal Environmental Agency of Brazil. A species-specific DNA-based identification from three finning seizures in Brazil found at least 20 species from 747 shark fins, some of which were identified as endangered and protected under Brazilian legislation, while others were representative of restricted catches, according to Appendix II of CITES. In the seizure from Belém, 338 fins were identified as belonging to at least 19 different species, while in the seizure from Natal 211, fins belonging to at least 8 different species were identified. Furthermore, 198 fins from Cananéia were identified through PCR-Multiplex as belonging to Isurus oxyrinchus. These results raise concerns about the environmental and socioeconomic effects of finning on developing countries. Furthermore, this study represents the first finning evaluation from Brazil in the Southwest Atlantic, highlighting the importance of developing policies aimed toward restricting and regulating the shark trade and detecting IUU fisheries and illegal trade of endangered species, mainly in developing countries, where fisheries management, surveillance, and species-specific fisheries catch data are often sporatic. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={The nematode genus Bidigiticauda has 2 species (Bidigiticauda vivipara and Bidigiticauda embryophilum), which are parasites of bats from the Neotropical region. The present paper describes a new species of Bidigiticauda from a male Artibeus planirostris specimen collected in the Pratigi Environmental Protection Area in Bahia state, Brazil. The new species, Bidigiticauda serrafreirei n. sp., differs from B. embryophilum by having longer spicules, rays 5 and 6 arising from a common trunk and bifurcating in its first third, rays 3 and 4 emerging slightly separated from each other, and dorsal rays reaching the margin of the caudal bursa. The new species also differs from B. vivipara by the dorsal ray bifurcating at the extremity of the trunk. A molecular phylogenetic analysis was conducted to determine the evolutionary affinities of Bidigiticauda serrafreirei n. sp. within the Strongylida, which identified a clade that grouped Bidigiticauda with the other members of the Anoplostrongylinae. However, the molineid subfamilies did not group together, indicating that the family Molineidae is polyphyletic. Further analyses, which include additional taxa and genetic markers, should elucidate the complex relationships within the Molineidae, in particular its subfamilies and the evolution of the traits that define these groups.},

abstract={Background: GATA2 is a transcription factor that is a critical regulator of gene expression in hematopoietic cells. GATA2 deficiency presents with multi-lineage cytopenia, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections. Patients with GATA2 mutation have a high risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Case presentation: We described a 43 years-old white male with 20-year follow-up of autoimmune and thrombotic phenomena, hypothyroidism, disseminated refractory Mycobacterium kansasii infection and MonoMAC syndrome. GATA2 c.1061 C > T; p.T354 M mutation was identified after he progressed from myelodysplastic pancytopenia to refractory anemia with excess blasts type II. His relatives were also investigated and he underwent unsuccessful haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We discuss the clinical features, genetic diagnosis and treatment of this immunodeficiency disorder. Conclusions: This case illustrates the challenge how a multidisciplinary disease should be handle. Once usual causes of immunodeficiency were excluded, clinicians should considerGATA2 deficiency in patients with myelodysplasia and long-standing Mycobacterium kansasii infection. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Today, elasmobranchs are one the most threatened vertebrate groups worldwide. In fact, at least 90% of elasmobranch species are listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, while more than 40% are data-deficient. Although these vertebrates are mainly affected by unsustainable fishery activities, bycatch is also one of the major threats to sharks and batoids worldwide, and represents a challenge for both sustainable fishery management and for biodiversity and conservational efforts. Thus, in this study, DNA barcode methodology was used to identify the bycatch composition of batoid species from small-scale industrial fisheries in the southwest Atlantic and artisanal fisheries from southeast Brazil. A total of 228 individuals belonging to four Chondrichthyes orders, seven families, and at least 17 distinct batoid species were sequenced; among these individuals, 131 belonged to species protected in Brazil, 101 to globally threatened species, and some to species with trade restrictions provided by Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). These results highlight the impacts on marine biodiversity of bycatch by small-scale industrial and unmanaged artisanal fisheries from the southwest Atlantic, and support the implementation of DNA-based methodologies for species-specific identification in data-poor fisheries as a powerful tool for improving the quality of fisheries’ catch statistics and for keeping precise bycatch records. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Background: Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) is a rare genetic disease characterized by body fat abnormalities that lead to insulin resistance (IR). Clinical conditions linked to milder IR, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome, are associated with abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, but little is known about its activity in FPL. Methods: Patients meeting the clinical criteria for FPL were subjected to anthropometric, biochemical and hormone analyses. A genetic study to identify mutations in the genes encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) was performed. Polycystic ovary syndrome and hepatic steatosis were investigated, and the patient body compositions were analyzed via dual X-ray energy absorptiometry (DXA). The HPA axis was assessed via basal [cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol binding globulin, nocturnal salivary cortisol and urinary free cortisol (UFC)] as well as dynamic suppression tests (cortisol post 0.5 mg and post 1 mg dexamethasone). Results: Six patients (five female and one male) aged 17 to 42 years were included. In DXA analyses, the fat mass ratio between the trunk and lower limbs (FMR) was > 1.2 in all phenotypes. One patient had a confirmed mutation in the PPARγ gene: a novel heterozygous substitution of p. Arg 212 Trp (c.634C>T) at exon 5. HPA sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback was preserved in all six patients, and a trend towards lower basal serum cortisol, serum ACTH and UFC values was observed. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that FPL is not associated with overt abnormalities in the HPA axis, despite a trend towards low-normal basal cortisol and ACTH values and lower UFC levels. These findings suggest that the extreme insulin resistance occurring in FPL may lead to a decrease in HPA axis activity without changing its sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback, in contrast to the abnormalities in HPA axis function in T2D and common metabolic syndrome. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={The catshark genus Scyliorhinus belongs to the family Scyliorhinidae, the most diverse family of sharks, and currently presents 16 valid species according to most modern accounts. The long history of taxonomic rearrangements and inaccurate descriptions of many species have contributed to misidentification of specimens and lack of information on the distributional range and diagnostic characters of its species. Species of Scyliorhinus are reviewed and redescribed here, with detailed descriptions on external morphology, neurocranium, claspers, dermal denticles, and tooth morphology provided for the first time for all species. Sixteen species are recognized as valid: Scyliorhinus boa (Goode & Bean, 1896), S. cabofriensis Soares, Gomes & de Carvalho, 2016, S. canicula (Linnaeus, 1758), S. capensis (Müller & Henle, 1838), S. cervigoni Maurin & Bonnet, 1970, S. comoroensis Compagno, 1988, S. duhamelii (Garman, 1913), S. garmani (Fowler, 1934), S. haeckelii (Miranda Ribeiro, 1907), S. hesperius Springer, 1966, S. meadi Springer, 1966, S. retifer (Garman, 1881), S. stellaris (Linnaeus, 1758), S. torazame (Tanaka, 1908), S. torrei Howell-Rivero, 1936, and S. ugoi Soares, Gomes & Gadig, 2015. The main taxonomic decisions herein taken include the resurrection of S. duhamelii (previously a junior synonym of S. canicula) and the synonimization of S. tokubee with S. torazame. Information on geographic distribution was updated for most species, especially for those with wide ranges (S. canicula, S. haeckelii, S. retifer, and S. stellaris). Copyright © 2019 Magnolia Press},

abstract={Here, we report trading of endangered shark species in a world hotspot for elasmobranch conservation in Brazil. Data on shark fisheries are scarce in Brazil, although the northern and northeastern regions have the highest indices of shark bycatch. Harvest is made primarily with processed carcasses lacking head and fins, which hampers reliable species identification and law enforcement on illegal catches. We used partial sequences of two mitochondrial genes (COI and/or NADH2) to identify 17 shark species from 427 samples being harvested and marketed on the northern coast of Brazil. Nine species (53%) are listed under some extinction threat category according to Brazilian law and international authorities (IUCN - International Union for Conservation of Nature; CITES - Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The number increases to 13 (76%) if we also consider the Near Threatened category. Hammerhead sharks are under threat worldwide, and composed 18.7% of samples, with Sphyrna mokarran being the fourth most common species among samples. As illegal trade of threatened shark species is a worldwide conservation problem, molecular identification of processed meat or specimens lacking diagnostic body parts is a highly effective tool for species identification and law enforcement. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Morphological identification in the field can be extremely difficult considering fragmentation of species for trade or high similarity between congeneric species. In this context, the shark group belonging to the genus Squatina is composed of three species distributed in the southern part of the western Atlantic. These three species are classified in the IUCN Red List as endangered, and they are currently protected under Brazilian law, which prohibits fishing and trade. Molecular genetic tools are now used for practical taxonomic identification, particularly in cases where morphological observation is prevented, e.g., during fish processing. Consequently, DNA barcoding was used in the present study to track potential crimes against the landing and trade of endangered species along the São Paulo coastline, in particular Squatina guggenheim (n = 75) and S. occulta (n = 5), as well as the Brazilian guitarfish Pseudobatos horkelii (n = 5). DNA barcoding revealed the continuous fishing and trafficking of these protected species, thus giving clear evidence that the current conservation models and methods of monitoring are not working. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Elasmobranchs, the group of cartilaginous fishes that include sharks and rays, are especially vulnerable to overfishing due to low fecundity and late sexual maturation. A significant number of elasmobranch species are currently overexploited or threatened by fisheries activities. Additionally, several recent reports have indicated that there has been a reduction in regional elasmobranch population sizes. Brazil is an important player in elasmobranch fisheries and one of the largest importers of shark meat. However, carcasses entering the shark meat market have usually had their fins and head removed, which poses a challenge to reliable species identification based on the morphology of captured individuals. This is further complicated by the fact that the internal Brazilian market trades several different elasmobranch species under a common popular name: "cação." The use of such imprecise nomenclature, even among governmental agencies, is problematic for both controlling the negative effects of shark consumption and informing the consumer about the origins of the product. In this study, we used DNA barcoding (mtDNA, COI gene) to identify, at the species level, "cação" samples available in local markets from Southern Brazil. We collected 63 samples traded as "cação," which we found to correspond to 20 different species. These included two teleost species: Xiphias gladius (n = 1) and Genidens barbus (n = 6), and 18 species from seven elasmobranch orders (Carcharhiniformes, n = 42; Squaliformes, n = 3; Squatiniformes, n = 2; Rhinopristiformes, n = 4; Myliobatiformes, n = 3; Rajiformes, n = 1; and Torpediniformes, n = 1). The most common species in our sample were Prionace glauca (n = 15) and Sphyrna lewini (n = 14), while all other species were represented by four samples or less. Considering IUCN criteria, 47% of the elasmobranch species found are threatened at the global level, while 53% are threatened and 47% are critically endangered in Brazil. These results underline that labeling the meat of any shark species as "cação" is problematic for monitoring catch allocations from the fishing industry and discourages consumer engagement in conservationist practices through informed decision-making. © 2018 Almerón-Souza, Sperb, Castilho, Figueiredo, Gonçalves, Machado, Oliveira, Valiati and Fagundes.},

abstract={Brazil has one of the richest biodiversities in the world. The Brazilian savanna is a hotspot for conservation priorities and its deforestation is of global concern. Conservation in this biome is threatened by unsustainable use of forests, such as illegal logging for charcoal production. Thus, government agents need to verify whether charcoal loads follow the Document of Forestry Origin (DOF). To improve charcoal identification, our study presents the microscopic description of 10 Cerrado species and provides an identification key to aid government agents during surveillance. We analysed charcoal samples with a scanning electron microscope. The method of carbonisation simulated real conditions. We chose species with similar wood anatomy (sparse axial parenchyma and narrow rays), which increases misidentification by forest controllers because of their difficulty to identify these features. Also, paratracheal scanty, diffuse and diffuse-in-aggregates parenchyma were harder to recognise in charcoal than in wood. Other features, such as vessels, rays and abundant axial parenchyma, were easily identified. The present work can be used as a part of a charcoal anatomy database focussed on preventing deforestation in Brazil and in other countries with similar problems. © 2018 CSIRO.},

The identification of T. pascuali is additionally corroborated by genetic divergence based on DNA-barcode analysis. Osteological and myological data unequivocally support the inclusion of the new species in the Trichomycterinae and molecular analyses justify its allocation to the genus Trichomycterus rather than Eremophilus, a trichomycterine taxon traditionally diagnosed by the lack of pelvic fins.

abstract={A new species of trypanorhynch cestode is described from two species of stingrays, the Panamic stingray Urotrygon aspidura (Jordan & Gilbert) and the Pacific chupare Himantura pacifica (Beebe & Tee-Van) collected in the Golfo de Montijo in the Eastern Pacific Ocean off the coast of Panama. Shirleyrhynchus panamensis n. sp. represents an important addition to the family, which until now consisted of two monotypic genera. The new species is characterised by an elongate scolex with four, ovate bothria, presence of prebulbar organs, absence of gland cells within the muscular bulbs and an oncotaxy with a typical heteroacanthous, heteromorphous tentacular armature, a characteristic basal armature and the presence of a slight basal swelling. It is readily distinguished from its congeners by a smaller scolex and features of the oncotaxy, such as dissimilar hooks on opposing principle rows, a commencement of hook rows from the bothrial to the antibothrial surface and a much shorter basal armature. Although described only on the basis of immature worms lacking a strobila, the new species adds information on features of the oncotaxy within Shirleyrhynchus Beveridge & Campbell, 1988. Observation of the holotype of Shirleyrhynchus aetobatidis (Shipley & Hornell, 1906) revealed apparent differences from Australian specimens that have been described as Shirleyrhynchus butlerae Beveridge & Campbell, 1988 but which were later synonymised. Observations of type-specimens of S. butlerae also revealed differences from the original description and some morphological characteristics are amended. Shirleyrhynchus butlerae is herein resurrected and an amended generic diagnosis and a key to the identification of species are provided. The molecular voucher specimen of ‘S. aetobatidis’ utilised in previous molecular phylogenetic studies was re-observed which revealed a misidentification of the specimen with Parachristianella indonesiensis Palm, 2004. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={In Brazil, the demand for sustainably certified seafood is increasing and retailers have promised to source all seafood from sustainable sources by 2015. In the southern portion of the country, elasmobranch meat is sold as cação, and consumers are often unaware that cação refers to any type of elasmobranch. The present study used questionnaires to investigate the lay public's knowledge of elasmobranch meat sold in a Brazilian city. Shoppers were surveyed at supermarkets in Curitiba, the largest city in southern Brazil. The study revealed that people do not link commercialized cação meat to sharks and rays (Elasmobranchii), with more than half of respondents who claimed to have already eaten cação did not think they had ever eaten shark or ray. The educational profile of interviewees suggests that this lack of knowledge may be even more common in other segments of Brazilian society. Therefore, we suggest that ecological information about elasmobranchs should be included in Brazilian elementary and high school curricula. Such a measure has the potential to modify behavior, create awareness, and stimulate responsibility throughout society, with the primary goal of reducing shark meat consumption and, ultimately, guaranteeing the long term conservation of marine resources. © 2015 Society of Ethnobiology.},

abstract={Fisheries statistics and stock assessment of many species of rays have been limited by the lack of information at the species level. Given the difficulty in identifying the four species within genus Dasyatis found in southeastern and southern Brazil, the aim of this work was to develop a methodology based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene to distinguish and register the capture frequencies of these species. Amplification of the COI region was performed using universal fish R1 and F2 primers, which generated amplicons of approximately 650. bp that subsequently were sequenced. The FokI restriction enzyme was selected and generated specific DNA fragments for each species, with two fragments for Dasyatis hypostigma (390 and 260. bp), three fragments for Dasyatis americana (300, 180 and 155. bp), two fragments for Dasyatis guttata (370 and 300. bp), and two fragments for Dasyatis centroura (410 and 200. bp). The same enzyme then was used to identify 97 samples of ray carcass tissues collected from fishery landings, and revealed a species occurrence of 90.7% for D. hypostigma, 5.1% for D. americana, 2.1% for D. guttata, and 2.1% for D. centroura. Thus, the PCR-RFLP technique can be used to efficiently identify these four species and serves as an indicator of the current catch rates. Moreover, the method can help solve misidentification problems and can be used routinely to monitor landings and to establish and implement plans for fishery management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Despite the widespread distribution of Cercopithifilaria bainae among canine and tick populations worldwide, this filarioid is currently considered of 'minor importance' in veterinary medicine, particularly when compared to related filarioids, such as Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens. To date, only a single case of dermatological alterations possibly associated to infection by C. bainae had been reported in a dog. In the present study, we describe the first case of systemic alterations associated to C. bainae infection in a dog suffering from diffused chronic polyarthritis. The animal had a previous history of reluctance to move and stiff gait and displayed multiple joint pain during manipulation of limbs. No biochemical, haematological and X-ray alterations were detected; microfilariae were observed in the synovial fluids collected from the joints. In spite of the morphological and molecular identification of these microfilariae as C. bainae, the dog did not respond to multiple microfilaricidal treatments with milbemicyn oxyme. The potential role of C. bainae in the pathogenesis of this clinical condition is discussed. Given the potential pathogenicity of this parasite, improved knowledge of this little known tick-borne nematode is warranted in order to assist the development of novel and effective treatment strategies. © 2014.},

abstract={Reductions of shark populations produce negative ecological and economic consequences. Overfishing is the primary threat to these reductions; however, two other indirect problems can be mentioned as threats to sharks populations: shark meat mislabeling, and shark attacks. In this study, we use Brazil as an example to focus on these three critical problems related to shark conservation: the lack of proper, specific identification of landed species in the industrial and artisanal fisheries; shark attacks; and mislabeling in markets. We discuss these situations, highlighting brief examples and conservation barriers. The main goal is to present these problems and provide simple, effective solutions. On the fisheries side, the solution lies in having trained personnel at specific landing ports. Implementation of this practice would also aid in the solution to the mislabeling of shark meat. However, whenever this does not occur, supermarkets or any other final seller should be held legally responsible for the identification. At this stage, genetic techniques such as DNA barcoding must be used. Regarding the shark attack problem, the only truly efficient solution with no indirect effects is education and taking the matter to society, rather than waiting until there is a shark attack incident. The government needs to invest more funds on educational awareness programs and research to avoid encounters with sharks. We must ensure that the society does not see sharks as villains, but instead as key elements in maintaining the ecosystem services that are so valuable to human well-being. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação.},

Its commercialization in Brazil is prohibited, but fresh or salted fillets of this fish can be found in markets, labeled as "sharks". In this study we performed genetic analyses on "shark" samples from two important fishery-trading ports in northern Brazil (Vigia and Bragança). Based on partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial 16S and Cyt b genes, 24 (55%) out of 44 samples were unequivocally identified as P. perotteti while the others comprised eight species of the families Carcharhinidae and Ginglymostomatidae. These results show that fishing surveillance and monitoring have not been effective to prohibit the commercialization of this highly endangered species. © 2013.},

abstract={Summary: Sharks of the genus Carcharhinus exhibit subtle morphological differences that are difficult to observe because of the common practice of head and fin removal, making species identification challenging. A total of 317 sharks, commonly called 'cação-baia' (large individuals) or 'machote' (small size) in Brazil, were captured by the tuna fleet at the Santos and Guarujá fishery ports on the southeastern coast of Brazil and identified at the species level by multiplex PCR. The Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 region of ribosomal DNA was amplified using universal primers, and species-specific primers were used for some of the Carcharhinus species. A total of 313 shark carcasses were directly identified by multiplex PCR. Four carcass samples did not amplify; therefore, the partial COI sequences were used to confirm their taxonomic identity. The results show that more than one species was being traded under the same commercial designation, including some Carcharhinus species that are under protection by federal legislation. Such species misidentification directly affects the long-term sustainability of sharks. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Background:The Dlx gene family encodes transcription factors involved in the development of a wide variety of morphological innovations that first evolved at the origins of vertebrates or of the jawed vertebrates. This gene family expanded with the two rounds of genome duplications that occurred before jawed vertebrates diversified. It includes at least three bigene pairs sharing conserved regulatory sequences in tetrapods and teleost fish, but has been only partially characterized in chondrichthyans, the third major group of jawed vertebrates. Here we take advantage of developmental and molecular tools applied to the shark Scyliorhinus canicula to fill in the gap and provide an overview of the evolution of the Dlx family in the jawed vertebrates. These results are analyzed in the theoretical framework of the DDC (Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation) model.Results:The genomic organisation of the catshark Dlx genes is similar to that previously described for tetrapods. Conserved non-coding elements identified in bony fish were also identified in catshark Dlx clusters and showed regulatory activity in transgenic zebrafish. Gene expression patterns in the catshark showed that there are some expression sites with high conservation of the expressed paralog(s) and other expression sites with events of paralog sub-functionalization during jawed vertebrate diversification, resulting in a wide variety of evolutionary scenarios within this gene family.Conclusion:Dlx gene expression patterns in the catshark show that there has been little neo-functionalization in Dlx genes over gnathostome evolution. In most cases, one tandem duplication and two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication have led to at least six Dlx coding sequences with redundant expression patterns followed by some instances of paralog sub-functionalization. Regulatory constraints such as shared enhancers, and functional constraints including gene pleiotropy, may have contributed to the evolutionary inertia leading to high redundancy between gene expression patterns. © 2013 Debiais-Thibaud et al.},

abstract={Obtaining accurate species-specific landings data is an essential step toward achieving sustainable shark fisheries. Globally distributed sharpnose sharks (genus Rhizoprionodon) exhibit life-history characteristics (rapid growth, early maturity, annual reproduction) that suggests that they could be fished in a sustainable manner assuming an investment in monitoring, assessment and careful management. However, obtaining species-specific landings data for sharpnose sharks is problematic because they are morphologically very similar to one another. Moreover, sharpnose sharks may also be confused with other small sharks (either small species or juveniles of large species) once they are processed (i.e., the head and fins are removed). Here we present a highly streamlined molecular genetics approach based on seven species-specific PCR primers in a multiplex format that can simultaneously discriminate body parts from the seven described sharpnose shark species commonly occurring in coastal fisheries worldwide. The species-specific primers are based on nucleotide sequence differences among species in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 locus (ITS2). This approach also distinguishes sharpnose sharks from a wide range of other sharks (52 species) and can therefore assist in the regulation of coastal shark fisheries around the world. © 2012 Pinhal et al.},

abstract={Among the diverse species of guitarfish, Rhinobatos horkelii is endemic to the south-west Atlantic and is primarily found off the Brazilian coast. The IUCN has classified this species as being in critical danger of extinction owing to widespread exploitation. Currently, this species is protected under Brazilian conservation laws. However, the morphological similarity of R. horkelii to other species precludes effective protection from fishing. Guitarfish samples were obtained from fishermen in different regions along the Brazilian coast and were identified using a genetic forensic method (multiplex-PCR). The analysis showed that 56% of the samples analysed were from R. horkelii, 25% from Rhinobatos percellens and 19% from Zapteryx brevirostris confirming that R. horkelii continues to be caught, despite conservation legislation. These results stress the need for effective conservation measures and may help to alert others to the occurrence of R. horkelii poaching. In addition, this work aims to establish an effective method of species identification to help prevent poaching of protected species such as R. horkelii. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

If the referred specimen (landed by fisheries in Ceará, northeastern Brazil) was misidentified (as Dasyatis centroura) in the field, why did its RAPD data fail to clarify the mistake? Was it due to limitations of RAPD markers or perhaps to a taxonomic issue? Contrary to our initial expectations, neither of these hindered the detection of the misidentification. After reanalyzing the primary genetic data associated with the misidentified specimen (PCR gel photographs and/or matrices of presence/absence of markers for six RAPD primers), we found that the RAPD markers were sufficient to correctly assign the misidentified specimen to its proper species identity. In the original study, the specimen misidentification was neither noticed by the authors nor apparent in the published article due to how their results were interpreted and presented.},

abstract={Introduction: Fungal infections in human skin, such as sporotrichosis, can occur after fish induced trauma. This work aimed to identify fungi in freshwater fish that are pathogenic to humans. Methods: Extraction of dental arches from Serrassalmus maculatus (piranha) and Hoplias malabaricus (wolf fish), stings from Pimelodus maculatus (mandis catfish), dorsal fin rays from Plagioscion spp. (corvina) and Tilapia spp., for culture in Mycosel agar. Some cultures were submitted to DNA extraction for molecular identification by sequencing ITS-5.8S rDNA. Results: Cultures identified most yeast as Candida spp., while sequencing also permitted the identification of Phoma spp. and Yarrowia lipolytica. Conclusions: While the search for S. schenckii was negative, the presence of fungus of the genera Phoma and Candida revealed the pathogenic potential of this infection route. The genus Phoma is involved in certain forms of phaeohyphomycosis, a subcutaneous mycosis caused by dematiaceous fungi, with reports of infections in human organs and systems. Traumatizing structures of some freshwater fish present pathogenic fungi and this may be an important infection route that must be considered in some regions of Brazil, since there are a large number of a fisherman in constant contact with traumatogenic fish.},

abstract={Nowadays, because of the constant increase in the capture and trade of sharks all over the world and reports of several species already showing important signs of over-exploitation, the establishment of registration mechanisms, evaluation and fishery control become urgent. Morphological identification of captured sharks is very difficult, and sometimes impossible, due to the removal of the animals' parts. At this point, techniques of genetic identification through the molecular markers are considered essential tools for fishery monitoring. In this study, we present a method of multiplex-PCR, based on the gene Cytochrome Oxidase I, with species-specific primers developed for simultaneous identification of nine species of lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks, some of which are worldwide distributed. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={Rhinobatos percellens, Rhinobatos horkelli and Zapteryx brevirostris, known as guitarfish, are commonly found inshore and caught by trawl nets. Recently, these species have been suffering sharp population declines. One of the main impediments to the development of conservation plans is the lack of information related to each species catch. Gathering this information is made more difficult by the fishermen's practice of removing parts of the animals before landing, as well as the morphological similarities among the three species. To address these issues, this work presents multiplex-PCR protocols that were developed to distinguish among these species using their genetic characteristics. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A molecular approach based on nuclear 5S rDNA sequence variability was applied successfully to correctly identify samples from the two Rhizoprionodon species collected in the wild or sold in markets. The sequence of the non-transcribed spacer (NTS) of the 5S rDNA showed high interspecific variability and no intraspecific polymorphism, making it a useful marker for sharpnose shark identification. Polymorphisms in the NTS sequences of Rhizoprionodon sharks also created unique restriction patterns for each species after PCR-RFLP analysis. The 5S rDNA polymorphism represents a fast and non expensive tool to access species identification when rapid and unequivocal identification of shark products is needed, particularly for future management and other investigations. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={Rhizoprionodon lalandii and R. porosus are widely distributed along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, living close to coastal areas and therefore frequently captured by seaboard fisheries. However, morphological identification of species in this genus is very difficult, especially when sharks have their heads and fins removed, making information about fishing, trading, and the evaluation of fishery effects on species conservation very difficult. This study's main objective is to develop molecular tools to identify these species using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. Both techniques result in good low-cost markers and may be very useful in future studies about the exploitation of these species. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The ongoing decline in abundance and diversity of shark stocks, primarily due to uncontrolled fishery exploitation, is a worldwide problem. An additional problem for the development of conservation and management programmes is the identification of species diversity within a given area, given the morphological similarities among shark species, and the typical disembarkation of processed carcasses which are almost impossible to differentiate. The main aim of the present study was to identify those shark species being exploited off northern Brazil, by using the 12S-16S molecular marker. For this, DNA sequences were obtained from 122 specimens collected on the docks and the fish market in Bragança, in the Brazilian state of Pará. We identified at least 11 species. Three-quarters of the specimens collected were either Carcharhinus porosus or Rhizoprionodon sp, while a notable absence was the daggernose shark, Isogomphodon oxyrhyncus, previously one of the most common species in local catches. The study emphasises the value of molecular techniques for the identification of cryptic shark species, and the potential of the 12S-16S marker as a tool for phylogenetic inferences in a study of elasmobranchs.

abstract={Aluminum-nitrogen thin films have been obtained under well-controlled conditions by ion-beam-assisted deposition (IBAD). The films were deposited on crystalline silicon and sapphire substrates at relative low temperature (∼325K). Taking advantage of the ion energy control provided by the IBAD technique, the films were prepared with N2+ ions with energies ranging from 100 to 300 eV. After deposition, the films were investigated by in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ex situ by optical spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. Detailed Raman scattering measurements in the 100-2500cm-1 wave number range were also performed revealing interesting features related to the atomic composition and structure of the films. The Raman data suggest that a misidentification of some vibration modes can lead to incorrect interpretations of the crystalline quality of aluminum-nitrogen films. Finally, the results indicate the suitability of IBAD to produce crystalline AlN films at considerably lower temperatures. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.},
